# Real Estate Dataset EDA & Cleaning
In this project I explore and clean a real estate data set that is intended to be used in a machine learning model to predict house price. The dataset had 80+ features and 1400+ records to begin with. I started with exploration, looking at distributions in order to determine the necessary steps to take in cleaning and getting the data machine learning ready. I then removed outliers as necessary, filled in missing values, encoded categorical values, looked at correlations, removed features displaying multicollinearity, selected the features to be used in the model (19 in total), and normalized numerical values.
## Steps for Running the Code:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:troppster225/bsan_6070
```
2. Install the following dependencies if not already installed:
* python 3.11.5
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* seaborn
* sklearn
3. Run the CA01.ipynb file in your IDE of choice
