# Customer Segmentation with kMeans clustiner
In this project, I performed customer segmentation using a K-Means clustering model. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. After preprocessing (including scaling and encoding), I applied the silhouette method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The final model grouped customers into six distinct segments, each representing different spending patterns, income levels, and demographic traits. The goal of the project is to help businesses better target their marketing efforts by understanding the key characteristics of each customer segment.
