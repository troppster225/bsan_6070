# BSAN 6070 Code Repository
This repository contains my work for the BSAN 6070: Introduction to Machine Learning course. The goal of this course is to provide a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and practical applications.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a separate assignment and contains the relevant data, as well as the associated Jupyter notebook (.ipynb).

Each folder includes:
- Data files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.)
- The Jupyter notebook for the assignment (assignment_X.ipynb), where all code, analysis, and results are documented.
