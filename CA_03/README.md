# Income Classification Using a Decision Tree
In this project I create an income classifier using a decision tree model. The data comes from the Census Bureau and contains data on income and demographics for over 48K people. This project entailed binning data to be more easily and meaningfully split by the model, cleaning, exploring, and encoding the data. Finally I looped through all of our hyperparameters in order to find the best combination that created the most accurate model.

## Steps for Running the Code:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:troppster225/bsan_6070
```
2. Install the following dependencies if not already installed:
* python 3.11.5
* pandas
* sklearn
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* graphviz
3. Open the CA 03 file
4. Open the CA03.ipynb file
5. Run each cell and read the comments and markdown to understand what's going on
6. If you would like to see the visualization using graphviz towards the end of the file, you will have to download both the python package and the regular graphviz application using Home Brew or by going to this link: https://graphviz.org/
