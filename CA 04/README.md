# Income Classification Using a Ensemble Models
Similar to the previous project, I create an income classifier but this time use different ensemble models. The data comes from the Census Bureau and contains data on income and demographics for over 48K people. This project entailed binning data to be more easily and meaningfully split by the model, cleaning, exploring, and encoding the data. Finally I tested four different ensemble models, measuring accuracy and AUC against the hyper parameter n_estimators to find the optimal value.

## Steps for Running the Code:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:troppster225/bsan_6070
```
2. Install the following dependencies if not already installed:
* python 3.11.5
* pandas
* sklearn
* seaborn
* matplotlib
3. Open the CA 04 file
4. Open the CA04.ipynb file
5. Run each cell and read the comments and markdown to understand what's going on
