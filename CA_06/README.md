# Streamlit Deployed Football App
This is a very simple demo of streamlit where we take a dataset containing football players, their clubs, ages, overalls, and more, and visualize it. The frontend is built with streamlit and deployed through their cloud service. This application has no machine learning involved, it is just a demonstration of how a GUI can be built with this python library.
